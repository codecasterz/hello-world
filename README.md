baby step to github

1. Create a Repository{A folder containing all contents of a project} by clicking + 

2. Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. The created repo has a default branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. We use other branches to experiment and make edits before commiting them to the master branch. When you create a branch off the master branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

Have you ever saved different versions of a file? Something like:
story.txt
story-joe-edit.txt
story-joe-edit-reviewed.txt
Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our master (production) branch. When a change is ready, they merge their branch into master.
